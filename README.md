# Cisco Networking Lab

This is a comprehensive Cisco Networking lab I created to gain hands-on experience across a wide range of core networking concepts. The lab covers topics such as VLANs, routing, SSH configuration, and more. It is designed to simulate real-world network scenarios using Cisco Packet Tracer and CLI configuration to reinforce both theoretical and practical skills.

## About This Project

This repository is structured into branches based on topic, with each lab focusing on a specific networking function or configuration challenge. Use the links above to explore each lab individually. Each file includes CLI configuration commands, topology diagrams, and explanations for the commands used.

Notes: All completed labs are fully tested and documented. This repository is actively being organized and expanded by adding finished labs progressively.
This repository assumes the reader has foundational knowledge of Cisco IOS commands and operational modes. Labs focus on demonstrating configuration skills and concepts rather than basic CLI instruction.
