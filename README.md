# Cisco Networking Lab

This is a comprehensive Cisco Networking lab I created to gain hands-on experience across a wide range of core networking concepts. The lab covers topics such as VLANs, routing, SSH configuration, and more. It is designed to simulate real-world network scenarios using Cisco Packet Tracer and CLI configuration to reinforce both theoretical and practical skills.

## About This Project

This repository is structured into branches based on topic, with each lab focusing on a specific networking function or configuration challenge. Use the links above to explore each lab individually. Each file includes CLI configuration steps, topology diagrams, and explanations for commands used.

Note: All completed labs are fully tested and documented. This repository is actively being organized and expanded by adding finished labs progressively.
